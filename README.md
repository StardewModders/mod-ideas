## For players
Submit ideas for mods you'd like to see here! To submit an idea:
1. Create a GitHub account.
2. Click 'New issue' on [the issues page](https://github.com/StardewModders/mod-ideas/issues).
3. Enter a title and description which explains your idea.

That's it! If a modder comment on your idea or creates the mod, you'll get a notification automatically. Note that your idea is more likely to be implemented if it's simple and fits the game style.

## For modders
Feel free to use any of the ideas listed [the issues page](https://github.com/StardewModders/mod-ideas/issues)! Make sure to add a comment if you start work on it (so other modders don't start on it too) or if you release the mod (so we can mark the idea implemented).

(Modders are welcome to submit ideas too, of course.)
